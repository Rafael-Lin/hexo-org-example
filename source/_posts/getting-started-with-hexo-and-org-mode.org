New to blogging with the [[https://hexo.io/][Hexo framework]] and [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]]? This tutorial will walk you through installing Hexo, running a local server, and creating your first blog post with [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]].

#+HTML: <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
*Disclaimer*

This post is based on [[https://www.cgmartin.com/2016/01/03/getting-started-with-hexo-blog/][Getting Started with the Hexo Blogging Framework]] by [[https://github.com/cgmartin][Christopher Martin]], which is a really nice post to getting start with [[hexo][Hexo Framrwork]].

* Installing the Hexo CLI

  #+HTML: <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
  *Requirements*

  You'll need [[https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node][Node.js]] and [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git][Git]] installed as pre-requisites.
  #+HTML: </div>

  Install the Hexo command line interface (CLI) globally with the Node.js package manager (NPM):

  : npm install -g hexo-cli

  ...once installed, use the =hexo init= command to create a new blog project:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    hexo init my-blog && cd my-blog
  #+END_SRC

  This step can take a few minutes while it creates an [[https://hexo.io/docs/setup.html][initial file structure for your site]] and downloads other Node.js dependencies.

* Installing the hexo-renderer-org

  Since we want to integrated [[hexo][hexo]] with [[org-mode][org-mode]], we need to install renderer plugin to make [[hexo][hexo]] can recognize the [[org-mode][org-mode]] file. Currently, there's two main org-mode renderer for hexo:

  - [[https://github.com/CodeFalling/hexo-renderer-org][CodeFalling/hexo-renderer-org]]
  - [[https://github.com/coldnew/hexo-renderer-org][coldnew/hexo-renderer-org]] (/fork/)

  This site is demo project for [[https://github.com/coldnew/hexo-renderer-org][coldnew/hexo-renderer-org]] so we'll use his fork instead. Install the renderer is really simple, just type:

  : npm install https://github.com/coldnew/hexo-renderer-org#coldnew --save

  then npm will save information to =package.json=.

  Now we need to modify the =_config.yml= to add some config for [[https://github.com/coldnew/hexo-renderer-org][coldnew/hexo-renderer-org]], you should add following contents:

  #+BEGIN_SRC yaml
    # hexo-renderer-org
    ## Docs: https://github.com/coldnew/hexo-render-org
    org:
      emacs: /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs
      cachedir: ./hexo-org-cache/
      theme: tango-dark
      common: |
        ,#+OPTIONS: html-postamble:nil
  #+END_SRC

  The =cachedir= is for [[https://github.com/coldnew/hexo-renderer-org][coldnew/hexo-renderer-org]] to store the cache files, this will speedup the render process.

  Since [[https://github.com/coldnew/hexo-renderer-org][coldnew/hexo-renderer-org]] can use [[emacs][emacs]] to syntax highlight your source code blocks, we setup the =theme= variable to specify emacs's build-in theme.
  To make [[emacs][emacs]] syntax highlight code blocks properly, we also need to modify =highlight.enable= in =_config.yml=

  #+BEGIN_SRC yaml
    highlight:
      # to make hexo-renderer-org htmlize content, this should set false
      enable: false
  #+END_SRC

* Starting the server

  To view your newly created site in a browser, start the local server:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    hexo server --draft --open

    INFO  Hexo is running at http://localhost:4000/hexo-org-example/. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
  #+END_SRC

  #+HTML: <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
  *Didn't work?*

  Your current working directory must be in the =my-blog= project folder, or the server will not start.
  #+HTML: </div>

  This starts the server with a few extra options:

  - =--draft=: Enable viwable /draft/ posts (by default, drafts are hidden)
  - =--open=: Open the local site in your browser

  A browser should pop up and display the default blog site with a canned "Hello World" post.

  You'll want to leave the server running in the terminal while authoring.The server process will watch for changes made to the [[org-mode][org-mode]] source files and automatically generate new HTML files.The server's console log output is also helpful for troubleshooting errors that you may run across.

  #+HTML: <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
  *Heads up*

  Be aware the some actions require a restart of the server:

    - Editing the project's =_config.yml=
    - Installing or updating Hexo plugins with =npm=
    - Making changes to local plugins within the =scripts= folder(s)

  Since most of the authoring time is spent within the org-mode files, a hard restart isn't require too often.
  #+HTML: </div>

* Creating your first post

  Since [[hexo][hexo]] doesn't support [[org-mode][org-mode]] officially, we start our first post on our own. Unlike [[markdown][Markdown]] which doesn't has a standard, a [[org-mode][org-mode]] post is just like other [[org-mode][org-mode]] post you write before, let's create a file named =My-First-Blog-Post.org= in =./source/_drafts/My-First-Blog-Post.org= and open the file with your favorite editor.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    emacs ./source/_drafts/My-First-Blog-Post.org
    # open and create ./source/_drafts/My-First-Blog-Post.org
  #+END_SRC

  Lets add some texts in our new post

  #+BEGIN_SRC org
    ,#+TITLE: My First Blog Post
    ,#+TAGS: org-mode, hexo

    This is some content.

    ,* Hello there

      This is other content.

      ,#+BEGIN_SRC sh
        # Test emacs's syntax highlight
        echo "Hello hexo-renderer-org"
      ,#+END_SRC
  #+END_SRC

  Saving changes to your [[org-mode][org-mode]] files will be automatically detected by the running =hexo server= and regenerated as static HTML files, *but you must refresh the browser to view the changes.*

  #+HTML: <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
  *Content not updated?*

  Due to some limitation, [[https://github.com/coldnew/hexo-renderer-org][coldnew/hexo-renderer-org]] may take more time (about 3 ~ 6 sec) to renderer your org-mode files, just be patient.
  #+HTML: </div>

  Your post should look something like this is browser:

  #+ATTR_HTML: :alt Screenshot of First Blog Post
  [[file:getting-started-with-hexo-and-org-mode/first-post.png]]

  If you dislike having to manually refresh the browser each time, the [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-livereload][hexo-livereload]] or [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-browsersync][hexo-browsersync]] plugins can do it automatically.

  To install the =hexo-browsersync= plugin (my personal favorite):

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    npm install hexo-browsersync --save
    hexo server --draft --open # restart the server
  #+END_SRC

  #+HTML: <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
  *Tip*

  Other [[https://hexo.io/plugins/][Hexo plugins]] can be easily installed in this same way, using =npm=.

  Many plugins will have configuration that can be tweaked form within the project's =_config.yml= file. You'll need to consult each plugin's documentation for their specific configuration properties.

  In the case of =hexo-browsersync=, the defaults work fine and don't requre editiog the =_config.yml= file.
  #+HTML: </div>

* Displaying summary excerpts in listings

  Say you have a lenghty post and don't like the fact that the entire article is displayed in the listing pages...

  You can mark a spot in your [[org-mode][org-mode]] file with =#+HTML: <!-- more -->= to hide it from the listing pages. It will be replaced with a "Read more" link that will open the rest of the article content.

  #+BEGIN_SRC org
    ,#+TITLE: My First Blog Post
    ,#+TAGS: org-mode, hexo

    This is a summary of the post.

    ,#+HTML: <!-- more -->

    This is some content.

    ,* Hello there

      This is other content.

      ,#+BEGIN_SRC sh
        # Test emacs's syntax highlight
        echo "Hello hexo-renderer-org"
      ,#+END_SRC
  #+END_SRC

* Inserting images

  Images and other asset files can be placed in subdirectories under the =./sources/= folder. Use this [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Ateam.jpg][picture of the original A-Team]] from Wikipedia as a test. Download it and save it to this path:

  : ./source/images/Ateam.jpg

  Edit your original post, inserting a markdown image link with a reference to =/images/Ateam.jpg=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC org
    ,#+TITLE: My First Blog Post
    ,#+TAGS: org-mode, hexo

    This is some content.

    [[file:/images/Ateam.jpg]]
  #+END_SRC

  However, this is not the [[org-mode][org-mode]] way to insert image, in [[org-mode]] way, we can use =M-x org-toggle-inline-image= to show the image in our emacs (GUI).

  To make assets be organized in *folders for each posts*. It requires enabling the =post_asset_folder: true= setting in =_config.yml=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC yaml
    post_asset_folder: true
  #+END_SRC

  After enable this feature, let's create a asset directory with the same name as our post:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    mkdir -p source/_posts/My-First-Blog-Post
    wget https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Ateam.jpg -O source/_posts/My-First-Blog-Post/Ateam.jpg
  #+END_SRC

  then, edit our [[org-mode][org-mode]] file, you can use =C-c i= to insert file you want;

  #+BEGIN_SRC org
    ,#+TITLE: My First Blog Post
    ,#+TAGS: org-mode, hexo

    This is some content.

    [[file:My-First-Blog-Post/Ateam.jpg]]
  #+END_SRC

  Now you should see something like this in the browser:

  [[file:getting-started-with-hexo-and-org-mode/add_image.png]]

* Publishing drafts

  When it's time to move the draft to a "live" post for the world to see, we just need move file in =sources/_drafts= folder to =sources/_posts= folder then add timestamp.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    # Move org-mode file
    mv sources/_drafts/My-First-Blog-Post.org  sources/_posts
    # Move assets
    mv sources/_drafts/My-First-Blog-Post      sources/_posts
  #+END_SRC

  Now, edit the =sources/_posts/My-First-Blog-Post.org=, add [[http://orgmode.org/guide/Export-options.html][Export-options]] =#+DATE:= to your post, you can use =C-u C-c .= add timestamp.

  Your posts should look like this:

  #+BEGIN_SRC org
    ,#+TITLE: My First Blog Post
    ,#+DATE: <2017-03-05 Sun 11:45>
    ,#+TAGS: org-mode, hexo

    This is some content.

    [[file:My-First-Blog-Post/Ateam.jpg]]
  #+END_SRC

  Finally, prepare the entire site for deployment. Run the =hexo generate= command:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    hexo generate
    # generates -> ./public/
  #+END_SRC

  Everything that is required to run the website will be placed inside the =./public= folder. You are all set to take this folder and transfer it to your public webserver or CDN.
